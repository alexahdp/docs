An `Organization` is a group of users, who were invited to work together.
Any user can create his own organization and invite other users to join it.
Organizations are designed for companies, schools, universities, and other institutions that need to manage the knowledge and skills of their employees or students.

In the organization settings page, you can configure the following settings:
 - organization name
 - url (domain)

#### Invitations
To join an organization, a user needs to receive an invitation from the organization's administrator.
After receiving an invitation, the user can accept it and join the organization.
In the Invites tab of the organization settings, you can view all sent invitations and their statuses. If you sent an invitation to the wrong email, you can revoke it.

### Roles and permissions
Organizations have users with different roles and permissions. Here are the roles and their differences:

#### Key roles
**Organization roles:**
 - **Member**: these users can create their tests, pass other tests, but they can't manage users: send invitations, block other users, create groups;
 - **Admin**: admins can create groups, assign other admins and managers to groups, and create assignments for the entire organization;
 - **Owner**: there is only one owner - the creator of the organization. The owner manages has all admin's privileges, and also he manages the subscription plan and can disable the organization;

**Roles in groups:**  
Groups have internal roles model. For example, an admin of the organization can be a member in some group or a user can be a manager in one group and a member in another group.
 - **Member**: users with these roles can only receive assignments for passing tests. They can't create assignments for other users in this group.
 - **Manager**: managers oversee the group. They can create assignments and assign them to users in the group. Managers can also add users to their groups.

#### Groups
Groups allow you to organize users to manage their assignments more effectively.
For example, you can create groups for developers, managers, and testers. Each group can have a manager who can assign tests for passing and monitor results.
