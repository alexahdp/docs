  <Accordion title='Can I protect the test from unauthorized access if the link is shared?'>

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title='Can I restrict test results visibility to only the author?'>
    Yes, you can set the test results to be visible only to you. When creating a test link, select the option "Results available to" and choose "Author". In this case, the test results will only be accessible to you, and no one else will be able to see them.

  <Accordion title='Can I limit the time for taking the test?'>
    Yes, you can set a time limit for taking the test. When creating a test link, specify a non-zero value in the "Time Limit" field. If set to zero, there will be no time limit. If the user does not complete the test within the allotted time, their answers will be automatically submitted, and the test will be considered completed.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title='How to restrict test access to specific users?'>
    You control who can access the test by creating test links. You can create a link that is only accessible to the users you send it to.
    There are additional settings that can help further restrict access to the test:
    1. When creating a test link with results available to you, you can specify a minimum number of uses in the "Number of Uses" field. For example, if you set it to 1, the link will be available for one-time use only.
    2. You can set a password for the test link. To do this, select the "Require Password" option when creating the test link and specify a value in the "Password" field. Users will need to enter this password to start the test.
    You will need to send the password to the users you want to grant access to the test.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title='What if the user closes the test before completing it and does not click the "Submit Answers" button?'>
    No worries, in this case, the user's answers will not be saved, and the test will automatically be completed after 3 hours.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title='Can I import a test from an existing PDF document?'>
    Yes, you can import a test from a PDF document. To do this, go to the My Tests page (/my-tests), click "Create Test" -> "Import Questions". In the pop-up window, select the PDF file containing the questions. The system will automatically create a test with questions from the document. Please note that the formatting of the questions may not be perfect, and you may need to make some adjustments.

    Additionally, you can take screenshots of questions and upload them through the AI assistant chat. On the test editing page, click on the "Create with AI" icon at the bottom of the screen. In the opened window, you can paste a screenshot of the question into the input field, and the system will attempt to recognize the text in the image and create a question.
