An `Assignment` is a directive for a user or a group of users to take a test. Assignments are only available within organizations.

#### Creating an assignment

Assignments are used to assess the knowledge and skills of employees in organizations.
When you create an assignment, you can set the following:
 - **Test**: Choose a published test that you can edit.
 - **Number of Attempts**: Set the number of attempts allowed to pass the test.
 - **Start Date**: Specify when the test becomes available.
 - **End Date**: Specify when the test is no longer available.
 - Assignees: Select users or groups of users to assign the test to.
Note: you can only assign the test to users in groups where you are a manager. If you are an administrator, you can assign the test to any user in the organization.

After publishing an assignment, users will see it in "My assessments" and can take the test between the start and end dates. Users will also receive an email notification about the assignment.

#### Assignment results

You can view the results of users who have taken the test within the assignment. You can see all attempts and view the details of each attempt.

Once an assignment is completed, you can move it to the archive. Archived assignments are no longer available for users to take, but you can still view the results.
