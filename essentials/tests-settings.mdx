- **All without explanations**. Correct and incorrect answers and statistics are visible to the user. Only explanations are hidden.

  The user also has access to test completion statistics.
- **Statistics**. In this case, the user will see only the general statistics of passing the test, the number of correct and incorrect answers.

## Time limit min

This setting limits the time for taking the test. Values are indicated in minutes. A value of 0 (default) means there is no time limit for taking the test.

## Passing threshold

Based on the test results, passing is graded as a pass or fail. This setting allows you to specify the percentage of correct answers so that the test is considered successfully completed.

## Number of questions in assessment

This setting allows you to specify how many questions will be included in the test for the user. for example, you have a test with 100 questions. If you write a value of 25 here, then each time the test is taken the user will be asked only 25 random questions from your test out of a possible 100.

## Random questions order
If you enable this option, the order of questions in the test will be new each time you take the test. This can help avoid cheating if a group of people take the same test. 


## Random options order
The setting is similar to the previous one. But in this case, the answer options in each question will be in a different order each time you take the test.
