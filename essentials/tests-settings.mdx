## Invitation required

This option prevents users who do not have an invitation from taking the test. For more information about invitations, see the the [Invites](/essentials/invites) section

## Topic

Each test can have a topic. We recommend using common values, such as "Programming", "Mathematics", "Languages"

## Tags

You can specify a list of tags for a test. We suggest using more specific values, such as "backend", "java", "grammar", etc.

## Url

You can create a custom link for each test. The test will be available to take through this link for all users (If you have not selected invitation required). The link consists of three parts:

- TestsPlatform domain
- The first and last name of the test creator (you can change this on the [profile edit page](/essentials/edit-profile))
- The test's title (this part of the link is editable)

## Answers and results visibility

This setting allows you to control the visibility of question explanations and correct answers after passing the test. The following options are available for configuration:

- **All** (default): All explanations and correct and incorrect answers are visible to the user after taking the test. All explanations and statistics are also available. (Statistics are general information about the number of questions answered correctly, incorrectly and missed)
- **All without explanations**. Correct and incorrect answers and statistics are visible to the user. Only explanations are hidden.
- **Correctness and statistics**. The user sees the answers to which he answered correctly and incorrectly, but for questions answered incorrectly, he does not see the correct option.
  The user also has access to test completion statistics.
- **Statistics**. In this case, the user will see only the general statistics of passing the test, the number of correct and incorrect answers.
- **Nothing**. The user who takes the test does not see any results about the test.

## Time limit min

This setting limits the time for taking the test. Values are indicated in minutes. A value of 0 (default) means there is no time limit for taking the test.

## Passing threshold

Based on the test results, passing is graded as a pass or fail. This setting allows you to specify the percentage of correct answers required for the test to be considered successfully completed. In this case, only questions with correct answers will be counted. If the user skips a question, it will be considered as an incorrect answer.

## Number of questions in assessment

This setting allows you to specify how many questions will be included in the test for the user. For example, if you have a test with 100 questions and write a value of 25 here, then each time the test is taken, the user will be asked only 25 random questions from your test out of a possible 100.

## Random questions order

If you enable this option, the order of questions in the test will be new each time the test is taken. This can help prevent cheating if a group of people take the same test.

## Random options order

This setting is similar to the previous one. However, in this case, the answer options in each question will be in a different order each time the test is taken.
