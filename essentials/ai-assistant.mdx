This guide will help you understand how to effectively interact with the AI-Assistant to create the best possible tests and surveys.

## How to Effectively Interact with the AI Assistant

Our AI assistant, powered by ChatGPT, is designed to help you create high-quality survey questions based on real-life scenarios and specific topics.

### Enhancing Question Quality

To get the best results from the AI, follow these steps:
 - **Define the survey topic.**
 - **Provide a Detailed description of the test.**   
When describing your survey, be specific about its purpose and content. Mention the intended audience to help the AI tailor questions appropriately.
Also, clearly outline the types of knowledge or skills the survey aims to assess. This detailed context enables the AI to generate more relevant and targeted questions.
 - Create a few questions manually as examples to guide the AI.

The more questions you generate, the better the AI understands the type of questions you need.

### Writing Effective Prompts

**1. Reference previous questions.**

If a question generated by the AI is too brief, reference it in your prompt to ask for a more detailed question.

Example:
```
The last question was too brief. Please formulate a more detailed question.
```


**2. Build on good questions.**

If the AI produces a particularly good question, use it as a reference for future ones.

Example:
```
This is a good question format. Generate more questions like this,
focusing on the following scenario: {scenario description}
```

**3. Manual adjustments.**

The AI may not always capture your exact requirements. For instance, a question might be good, but the answer options may need improvement.
In such cases, manually edit the questions to fit your needs.
