To make creating tests more convenient and simpler, we have introduced an AI-assistant.

At this point, the assistant will help you in several places. The first is the actual creation of the test. The second is the description of the question.

## Creating a test using the AI-assistant

On the test editing page at the bottom you can see a button "Generate with AI". By clicking on this button, you will have a modal assistant window at your disposal.
You can also open the question editing drawer, in which you will have access to a second button to call the assistant.
These two dialogues are not much different. In both cases, you have an assistant at your disposal, who will answer almost any of your requests with a generated question that you can use in your test.
The differences between these dialogues are as follows:

- **Generati with AI** button. You can directly insert questions generated in this dialogue into the list of questions in your test using the `Add to test` button. If you want to change a question generated using the assistant, we can add it to the question editing window using the `Edit` button.

- **AI** button. Questions generated in this dialog box can be added to the edited question canvas. It is not possible to directly add questions to your test list from this window.

The window itself has an intuitive interface. When you use the assistant for the first time, you will be offered several instructions and a short guide on how to use the assistant. We recommend that you spend some time getting to know it. This will help you interact with your assistant more productively.

Here are some recommendations for more effective interaction with assistant:

- **Define the survey topic in Settings**. This will help the assistant generate questions more accurately and not go beyond the topic that you specified in the test settings. You can find out more about test settings and topics [here](/essentials/tests-settings#topic).
- **Provide a Description**. This will allow the AI-assistant dive deeper into the context of the test, which will make the AI-assistant's answers more accurate.
- **Write a few questions manually**. The questions you create will fall into the context of the assistant, and all questions generated by it will be, to one degree or another, similar to yours. They may be similar in writing style, complexity, etc.
