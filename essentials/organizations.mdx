An `Organization` is a group of users, who were invited to work together.
Any user can create his own organization and invite other users to join it.
Organizations are designed for companies, schools, universities, and other institutions that need to manage the knowledge and skills of their employees or students.

In the organization settings page, you can configure the following settings:
 - organization name
 - url (domain)

#### Invitations
To join an organization, a user needs to receive an invitation from an organization administrator.
After receiving an invitation, the user can accept it and join the organization.
In the Invites tab of the organization settings, you can view all sent invitations and their statuses. If you send an invitation to the wrong email, you can revoke it.

### Roles and permissions
Organizations have users with different roles and permissions. Here are the roles and their differences:

#### Key roles
 - **Member**: A basic user who can participate in assignments, take free-to-pass tests, and create their own tests.
 - **Manager**: Managers oversee a specific group. They can create assignments and assign them to users in their groups.
 Managers can also add users to their groups. Note: a user can be a manager in one group and a member in another group.
 - **Admin**: Admins can create groups, assign other admins and managers to groups, and create assignments for the entire organization.
 - **Owner**: There is only one owner, who is the creator of the organization. The owner manages the subscription plan and can disable the organization.

#### Groups
Groups allow you to organize users and manage their assignments more effectively.
For example, you can create groups for developers, managers, and testers. Each group can have a manager who can assign tests for passing and monitor results.
