A `Published test` is a snapshot of a test at the moment of publishing. You can share a link to a public test with anyone.
If a user takes the test via your link and does not have an account on Testsplatform, they can pass the test, but to see their results they will need to create an account.
A cookie mechanism is used to bind the assessment with the user. If the user clears their cookies before creating an account, the information about taking the test will be lost.

You cannot see users and their results from tests shared via a link.

#### Unpublishing
If you no longer want your test to be available, you can unpublish it.
After unpublishing, the test will not be accessible via direct link, and it cannot be taken again.
However, users who have already taken the test will still see it in their assessments and can view questions, answers, and explanations.

#### Statistics
For a published test, you can view common statistics, which include:
 - average results  
 - best result  
 - worst result  
These statistics include all attempts (via invites, links, etc.).

#### Invites
If you want to track the results of a specific user, you can create an invite.
You can name your invite (e.g., name, email, or any identifier). After creating an invite, share it with the user.
An invite can only be used once. Once a user uses an invite to take a test, it is marked as used and cannot be reused.
After the user completes the test via the invite, you can view their results by clicking on their username in the list of invites.

#### Assignments
For organizations, published tests can be used in assignments. Note: if you update a test, the updates will not appear in assignments until you republish the test.
