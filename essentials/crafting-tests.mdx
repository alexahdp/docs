A `Test` is a set of questions grouped together. When you create a test, it starts as a draft. Draft tests are only visible to you.
You can add questions, update settings, and make changes without anyone else seeing them.

When you feel your test is ready, you can publish it. Only after publishing will the test be visible to others.

A `Published test` is a snapshot of your test at a certain point in time. After publishing, you can still update your test, but these updates won't be visible until you publish it again.

**Personal account**
When you publish a test, it becomes visible via a direct link. You can control who can take the test by setting the *invitation required* checkbox in the test's settings.
If checked, only users with an invite can take the test. If not checked, anyone with the direct link can take the test.

**Organization account**
In an organization, you have more control over test visibility. In the settings panel, there is a *Test visibility level* select option. This lets you control who can see the test.
 - `Only assignees in the organization`: The test preview is available via a direct link, but to take the test, a user must have an invite or the test must
 be assigned to them. This is often used for assignments and assessments.
 - `Organization-wide`: Tests with this visibility level are available to everyone in your organization. These tests are shown in the Tests catalog, 
 and members of your organization can see and take them. These tests are not visible to users outside of your organization.
 - `Public`: These tests are visible to users outside of your organization, even those not signed up on the tests platform.
 This setting also includes the "invitation required" checkbox, which works the same as for a personal account.


### Settings panel

### Invitation required
Allows to manage visibility of a public test. When this option is chosen, only users with an invite may start passing a published test.  

#### Tags
You can attach tags to your tests to make them more specific.  
Tags are essential for further categorizing tests.  

#### Topics
You can assign a topic to your test. Topics help group and filter tests.

#### Url
You can set a human-readable URL for your test. A full URL link consists of three parts:
 - testsplatform.com domain
 - profile URL (or organization domain if the test belongs to an organization)
 - test's URL

**Be careful if you change parts of your test URL, including your profile's URL in your account settings. After changing the URL, the test will not be available at the previous URL**

#### Answers and results visibility
You can control what a user sees after they pass the test. Below is a table showing what users will see for each setting value:

|                 | All   | All without explanations | Correctness and statistics | Statistics | Nothing |
| ---             | ---   |           ---            |             ---            |     ---    |    ---  |
| Statistics      |  +    |             +            |               +            |      +     |    -    |
| Correctness     |  +    |             +            |               +            |      -     |    -    |
| Correct answers |  +    |             +            |               -            |      -     |    -    |
| Explanations    |  +    |             -            |               -            |      -     |    -    |

#### Time limit
You can set a time limit for taking the test. The value is in minutes. A value of 0 (default) means there is no time limit. 
If there is a time limit, the user will see a timer during the test. When the timer reaches 0, the user will be redirected to the test completion page
and won't be able to answer questions or update their assessment. The timer continues even if the user refreshes the page or closes and reopens it.  
Related setting: "Pausable", see below.

#### Passing threshold
You can set a passing threshold for the test, expressed as a percentage. If a user's score is above the threshold, the test is marked as passed. If below, it is marked as failed.

#### Number of questions in a test
To avoid having the same questions in every test, you can set a smaller number for `Number of questions in assessment` than the total number of questions.
This way, each time a user takes the test, they will receive a random subset of questions. For example, if your test has 100 questions and you set the value to 25,
each user will see 25 random questions out of 100.

#### Random questions order
If enabled, the order of questions will be different each time the test is taken. This can help prevent cheating.
​
#### Random options order
Similar to random question order, this setting shuffles the answer options within each question each time the test is taken.
Be careful with this setting if your options are labeled (A, B, etc.) as explanations won't update with the shuffling.

#### Pausable
When this setting is active, a user can pause a test and it's timer will be stopped. User may leave the page and get back after a long time and he will
be able to resume the test and continue answer questions.

#### Learning mode
This setting allows to immediately show answer for the questions in a test. For example, you want to use a test in learning purposes.
You create questions, add explanations and then when a user answers a question and clicks "next", he will immediately see is his answer correct or now, which answer
is correct and why (with explanation).


### Questions
A question is a building block of tests. Testsplatform allows you to create the following types of questions:
 - `single choice` - only one answer can be selected
 - `multiple choice` - multiple answers can be selected

#### Tags
You can attach tags to your questions. These tags will be used to group and analyze test results.
For example, you can tag some questions as Algebra and others as Geometry. After the test is completed, you will get statistics showing the user’s proficiency in each section.
For instance, you may find that the user excels in Algebra but struggles with Geometry. You can assign multiple tags to each question to enhance the organization of your test results.

#### Explanations
Tests can be used for educational purposes. If you want to provide explanations for each question, you can add them in the question settings.
Explanations are shown to the user after they complete the test. They help the user understand why their answers were correct or incorrect.
You can also automatically generate explanations for your questions using the AI-Assistant.
