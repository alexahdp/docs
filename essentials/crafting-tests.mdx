A `Test` is a set of questions grouped together. When you create a test, it starts as a draft. Draft tests are only visible to you.
You can add questions, update settings, and make changes without anyone else seeing them.

When you feel your test is ready, you can publish it. Only after publishing will the test be visible to others.

A `Published test` is a snapshot of your test at a certain point in time. After publishing, you can still update your test, but these updates won't be visible until you publish it again.

A `Published test` is a snapshot of a test at the moment of publishing. You can share a link to a public test with anyone.
If a user takes the test via your link and does not have an account on Testsplatform, they can pass the test, but to see their results they will need to create an account.
A cookie mechanism is used to bind the assessment with the user. If the user clears their cookies before creating an account, the information about taking the test will be lost.

You cannot see users and their results from tests shared via a link.

**Personal account**
When you publish a test, it becomes visible via a direct link. You can control who can take the test by setting the *invitation required* checkbox in the test's settings.
If checked, only users with an invite can take the test. If not checked, anyone with the direct link can take the test.

**Organization account**
In an organization, you have more control over test visibility. In the settings panel, there is a *Test visibility level* select option. This lets you control who can see the test.
 - `Only assignees in the organization`: The test preview is available via a direct link, but to take the test, a user must have an invite or the test must
 be assigned to them. This is often used for assignments and assessments.
 - `Organization-wide`: Tests with this visibility level are available to everyone in your organization. These tests are shown in the Tests catalog, 
 and members of your organization can see and take them. These tests are not visible to users outside of your organization.
 - `Public`: These tests are visible to users outside of your organization, even those not signed up on the tests platform.
 This setting also includes the "invitation required" checkbox, which works the same as for a personal account.


### Settings panel

#### Tags
You can attach tags to your tests to make them more specific.  
Tags are essential for further categorizing tests.  

#### Topics
You can assign a topic to your test. Topics help group and filter tests.

### Questions
A question is a building block of tests. Testsplatform allows you to create the following types of questions:
 - `single choice` - only one answer can be selected
 - `multiple choice` - multiple answers can be selected

#### Tags
You can attach tags to your questions. These tags will be used to group and analyze test results.
For example, you can tag some questions as Algebra and others as Geometry. After the test is completed, you will get statistics showing the userâ€™s proficiency in each section.
For instance, you may find that the user excels in Algebra but struggles with Geometry. You can assign multiple tags to each question to enhance the organization of your test results.

#### Explanations
Tests can be used for educational purposes. If you want to provide explanations for each question, you can add them in the question settings.
Explanations are shown to the user after they complete the test. They help the user understand why their answers were correct or incorrect.
You can also automatically generate explanations for your questions using the AI-Assistant.

#### Statistics
For a published test, you can view common statistics, which include:
 - average results  
 - best result  
 - worst result  
These statistics include all attempts (via invites, links, etc.).

For sharing tests you can use links. Look at the [test links](/essentials/test-links) page for more information.
