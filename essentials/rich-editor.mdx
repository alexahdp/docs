Rich Editor, multifunctional content editor, has implemented in TestsPlatform.

## Available Inputs

You can try its capabilities in the following text input fields:

- Test's description
- Question input
- Input for answer options
- Question's explanation

## Main Rich-Editor Menu

To start using it, click on any of the fields above. When you activate the input, you will see a "Plus" icon on the left. Clicking on it will bring up the rich editor menu. The second way to bring up the menu is to enter the symbol "/".

In the menu you will be able to select the main entities of the Rich editor:

1. **Hero.** It is a large bold font. We recommend using it as the main title of the text
2. **Paragraph.** This menu item is default. The text has normal width and size.
3. **Heading 2** Header component, but smaller than HERO.
4. **Heading 3** Also a header, but even less Hero and Heding 2
5. **Bulleted List** This is an unnumbered list. Each paragraph begins with a dot symbol
6. **Numbered List** As you might guess, it is a numbered list. Only numbers are used for numbering.
7. **Image** When you click on this menu item, you will have access to a modal window for uploading images.
8. **Code** Special component for code. Has a dark background color and white monospace font.
9. **Quote** Component for formatting a quote. Represents regular text with a special gray stripe on the left.

You can see the full menu only in the test description field. The rest of the input fields have an abbreviated menu, some components for headers or a component for inserting images are missing.

## Additional menu

If you enter some text into these inputs and then select it, a second rich editor menu will be available to you. In this menu, in addition to the already mentioned list options (numbered and unnumbered list) and components for quoting and code, you have access to text editing options, such as:

- **Bold**
- **Italiс**
- **Underline**
- **Strikethrought**

Also in this menu you have access to a tool for creating a link.

The Rich Editor simplifies content creation, offering versatile formatting tools and an intuitive interface. Combine different styles, lists, images, and links to create visually appealing and engaging text. Unleash your creativity with the Rich Editor – the perfect tool for crafting compelling content that resonates with your audience.
