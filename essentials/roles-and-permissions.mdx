## Roles and permissions

If you have an organization, then in your organization there are users with different roles and permissions. Let's consider which roles exist
in every organization and how their powers differ.

#### Key roles:
 - **member** - a simple user. User can participate in assignments, pass free-to-pass tests, create his own tests.
 - **manager** - every manager is a manager in a group. He can create assignments and assign them to users in his groups. A manager can add user into his groups.
  It is important to notice: a manager is related to a group. It means, that a user can be a manager in a one group and he is capable to create assignment for users in that group,
  and he can be a member in another group. In that group, where he is a member another manager can assign assignments to him.
 - **admin** - admins can create groups, nominate other admins and managers to groups. An admin can create assignments for an entire organization.
 - **owner** - only one user can be an owner - that, who created an organization. Owner manages subscription plan, and can disable the organization.
