## Roles and permissions

If you have an organization, then in your organization there are users with different roles and permissions. Let's consider which roles exist
in every organization and how their powers differ.

#### Key roles:
 - **member** - a simple user. User can participate in assignments, pass free-to-pass tests, create his own tests.
 - **manager** - every manager is a manager in a group. He can create assignments and assign them to users in his groups.
 - **admin** - admins can create groups, assign other admins and managers to groups.
 - **owner** - only one user can be an owner - that, who created an organization. Owner manages subscription plan, and can disable the organization.
