An `Assessment` is the process and result of taking a test. When a user starts a test, an assessment is created.
Each answer is saved to the assessment as the user progresses. When the user finishes the test, the assessment is completed, and the result is calculated.

During the assessment, the user can skip questions, move forward and backward, and change answers.
If there is a time limit, the user will see a timer during the test. When the timer reaches 0, the user will be redirected to the
test completion page and won't be able to answer questions or update their assessment.
The timer continues even if the user refreshes the page or closes and reopens it.
The user can finish the test before the time limit expires.

If the user doesn't complete the test by clicking the Finish button, the test will be automatically submitted after 3 hours.

Users can mark questions for review and see the list of marked questions after finishing the test.

Users can view their assessments in the My assessments section.

Depending on the test settings, the user can see the following information after passing the test:
 - **All** - all questions, answers, explanations, and statistics
 - **All without explanations** - all questions, answers, and statistics (without explanations)
 - **Correctness and statistics** - questions, answers, correctness, and statistics
 - **Statistics** - only statistics, his score, and passed or failed status
 - **Nothing** - nothing. User event will not know his score, passed or failed.
